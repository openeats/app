Open Eats Project - Android App
===============================

App Concept
-----------
How do we increase the dialog about healthy and unhealthy food choices in our fast-paced, social-networking society?  People try to consult nutritionists, keep food journals, count calories, but they’re not doing it.  They’d rather take a photo of their dessert to post online to make others jealous.

OpenEats aims to shed a new tint, on food choices by using a simple rating system (borrowed from Tinder). Swipe left for unhealthy, swipe right for healthy.  Instead of being distracted by your friend’s dessert photo, you can decide whether it was a good choice or not.

As the OpenEats community builds a gallery of food they have consumed, they get a real sense of their food choices since the results of voting will result in either a red or green tint on the food picture.

Social Good
-----------
Health awareness is a problem in this country. OpenEats is intended for anyone with a desire to improve their health but doesn’t know where to start. OpenEats aims to foster social engagement and social encouragement. The app also enables people with healthy diets to set and share positive examples with what they are eating. 

With Open Eats you’ll visually train your brain to think, “good or bad?”, as well as being presented with choices which have been voted to be great ideas.

Future Improvements

* image content recognition
* improve the voting algorithm
* geo-location tagging
